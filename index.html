  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Growing up in the suburbs of Atlanta, I have always been interested in fashion whether I knew it or not. I would buy copies of Tiger Beat, J-13, which turned into Teen Vogue and Seventeen, then graduating to Harper's Bazaar and Elle. I was unaware at the time that fashion jobs really existed, until it came time to start applying to colleges. I ended up at the University of Alabama, and majored in Fashion Merchandsing. A 5 month stint in New York City for a sales and marketing internship then started my  career in the industry. From there, I worked retail at Intermix (where I really learned how much I love luxury fashion), a men's store, and then my first wholesale job where I stayed in this particular part of the industry. This became a 6 year journey as a sales rep, working my way through different showrooms. I loved the travel, seeing small and big towns around the Southeast and West Coast. After realizing I was burnt out, I decided I wanted to make an industry change.</p>
  <h2>My Hopes for My Future</h2>
  <p>I am now 6 months into my journey in coding, and I love that I am learning a topic from the ground up. I hope to use what I am learning and will continue to learn to create beautiful websites for brands, stores, influencers and anything fashion related. I want my websites to exude a relatability, a coolness, an easiness, yet still aspirational in a way that doesn't make you annoyed by it. I hope to use my creative and salesman eye to excite people about what they are checking out in a website.</p>
  <p>With all of that being said, please enjoy this image of my role model Rihanna, who I hope one day goes to one of my websites one day.</p>
